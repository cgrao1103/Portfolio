                <p>I have completed several exciting tech internships that showcase my skills and enthusiasm for software development. These internships include developing dynamic web applications using modern frameworks and libraries, implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics, and creating interactive user interfaces that enhance user experience. My portfolio also features contributions to open-source internships, where Iâ€™ve collaborated with diverse teams to build and improve tools and applications. Each project has not only deepened my technical expertise but also honed my problem-solving abilities and passion for innovation in technology.</p>
